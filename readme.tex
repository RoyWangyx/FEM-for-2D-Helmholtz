 afun betafun ffun gfun vfun: coefficients a, beta, f, g, v respectively, defined on the whole domain (so of course beta and g vanishes except when on the boundary)\
\
elementstiff2.m: assembling the stiffness matrix\
\
FEM.m: FEM solution.\
\
The code is tailored to Robin boundary conditions. To run new tasks; simply change the con figurations of the coefficients afun betafun ffun gfun vfun.\
